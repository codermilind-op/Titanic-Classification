# Titanic Classifier Project
# Overview
This project aims to predict survival outcomes for passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. Leveraging the famous Titanic dataset, the classifier predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more.

# Features
**Data Exploration**: Explore and analyze the Titanic dataset to understand patterns and relationships among variables.

**Data Preprocessing**: Cleanse and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

**Classifier Implementation**: Implement machine learning models to predict survival outcomes. Experiment with algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.

**Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal results.
